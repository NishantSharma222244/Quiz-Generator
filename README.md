Dynamic Quiz Generator


Develop a dynamic quiz generator application that creates a quiz based on the difficulty level and topics specified by the user. The application should have the following features:

1. Topic Selection: Allow users (educators or students) to select one or more topics for the quiz. The topics can be predefined in a list or database that your application will use to generate questions.

2. Difficulty Levels: Implement at least three difficulty levels (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). The application should adjust the complexity of the questions based on the chosen difficulty level.

3. Question Bank: Create a question bank containing a minimum of 10 questions spread across the different topics and difficulty levels. Questions can be of various types (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, short answer).

4. Quiz Generation: Based on user input, dynamically generate a quiz with a specified number of questions, randomly selected according to the chosen topics and difficulty level. Ensure there is a balanced mix of question types.

5. Scoring and Feedback: After the quiz is completed, calculate the score and provide immediate feedback to the user. Offer explanations for the correct answers, especially for incorrectly answered questions.
